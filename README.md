# An Introduction to Molecular Response Properties

The goal of this introduction is not to replace other resources, several of which are touched upon in the document, but to "glue" them together in a way that makes sense to me as someone who has implemented these methods, and was unsatisfied with

This is extracted, adapted, and extended from the first chapter of my [doctoral dissertation](https://github.com/berquist/dissertation) and a [preprint](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.5773968.v1) on non-orthogonal linear response.

Many methods discussed here are implemented in [`pyresponse`](https://github.com/berquist/pyresponse), [`libresponse`](https://github.com/berquist/libresponse), or the [Psi4NumPy](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy/) project.
